Magnifractal
============

A fractal zooming/exploring tool. Under construction - mostly this was a fun weekend project to learn Java, but I'll try to make it a decent tool for exploring fractals. At the moment, its Mandelbrot only.

How to Use
==========

Compile using "javac Magnifractal.java".

Run it using "java Magnifractal".

Controls are as follows:

Mouse wheel: zoom in/out

'r': increase resolution (wraps around)

'u': set to min resolution (good for faster zooming)

't': set to max resolution (use for stunning images)

Arrow keys: panning (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
